# My Cat App

A Zendesk app for cat lovers that allows you to share humorous pictures of cats with your favourite customers.

Similar to the [Secure Settings Example App](https://github.com/zendesk/demo_apps/tree/master/v2/support/secure_settings_sample_app), this app leverages the secure settings functionality of Zendesk's App Framework to store an API token which is required for making requests to [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/). You can sign up for a for a free token [here](https://thecatapi.com/signup).

Upon installation, the account admin will need to enter this key in the api_token parameter.
